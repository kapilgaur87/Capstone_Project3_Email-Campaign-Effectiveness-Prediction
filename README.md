# Capstone_Project3_Email-Campaign-Effectiveness-Prediction

The main objective of this project is developing a machine learning model that can track  and classify the emails which has been sent using Gmail-based email marketing campaigns. This technique can be used by those small- to medium-sized business owners who want to boost the efficiency of their campaigns and boost client retention.

To identify which emails have been read, deleted, or acknowledged by the recepient is one of the key issues in email marketing. Companies can modify their marketing strategies based on this data.

The information on a range of email attributes, for example subject line, sender name, email content, email format, and frequency, will be collected. The emails that are intended for readership as well as any additional pertinent information will be taken into account.

This data will be used to train a machine learning model that will help us figure out whether a recipient is more likely to read, disregard, or acknowledge a message. This model will be able to evaluate recent emails and predict the reader's likely response.

To assess the model's performance between the training and testing sets of data, we will split our data into two sets: training and testing. The testing set will be used to evaluate the model's performance once the training set has been used to fit it. Precision, recall, and F1 score are a few of the measures we will use to assess the model's efficacy and accuracy.

After being trained and evaluated, the model can be used to assist small- to medium-sized business owners in improving the effectiveness of their email marketing efforts. By using the model to categorise and track emails, they will be able to better target their marketing efforts and increase client retention.

The main objective of this project is to provide small- to medium-sized business owners with a powerful tool for increasing the effectiveness of their email marketing campaigns. By using machine learning to classify and track emails, they will be better able to make decisions and increase the likelihood that their marketing campaigns will be effective.
